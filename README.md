## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Koquiun, also known as Franklin, and I am a graduate student from the University of Melbourne, majoring in Data Science. I am interested in Python & Data Science!

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning Power BI, cloud computing, and web developement.
- ğŸŒ± I recently built a testing pipeline for evaluating critical period effects in large language models using grammaticality judgments and perplexity-based accuracy metrics during my summer internship at the University of Melbourne as an undergraduate research student.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can speak 4 languages fluently.
