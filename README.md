## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Koquiun, also known as Franklin. I recently graduated from the University of Melbourne with a major in Data Science, and Iâ€™m passionate about Python and all things data science!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning Power BI, cloud computing, and web developement.
- ðŸŒ± I recently built a testing pipeline for evaluating critical period effects in large language models using grammaticality judgments and perplexity-based accuracy metrics during my summer internship at the University of Melbourne as an undergraduate research student.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can speak 4 languages fluently -- English, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Spanish.
